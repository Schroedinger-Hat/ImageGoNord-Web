# ImageGoNord - RGB image to Nordtheme palette
A tool that can convert your rgb images to nordtheme palette.

This repository is:
- CLI utility, written in python, that can convert any sort of image into a [nordtheme](https://github.com/arcticicestudio/nord) palette image;
- an API hosted on Heroku that is using the [ImageGoNord Python package](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/ImageGoNord-pip) written in Flask;
- a demo website hosted on Netlify made using the Nordtheme and VueJS;

**Are you looking for the python package?**

The official python package's repository is [ImageGoNord-pip](https://github.com/Schrodinger-Hat/ImageGoNord-pip). You are welcome :)

### Inspiration

We are in love with Nordtheme, that is why we created this repository.

[![Nord Color Palette Overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arcticicestudio/nord-docs/develop/assets/images/nord/repository-color-palettes.svg?sanitize=true)](https://www.nordtheme.com/docs/colors-and-palettes)

Our goal is to make a shortcut to convert anything into this theme, by starting from the images.
<br>An example could be an awesome wallpaper converted into the Nordtheme palette.

We checked the commnunity and we did not find anything similar or any project that can accomplish this task. So, here we are.

### Core Technical Concepts

We are using the PIL because it is the most simple library and it is very useful when you need to manipolate some images.

Our goal is also to make this project open source and maintainable by the community. We would love to.

*We believe in the open source community.*
